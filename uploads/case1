<p data-structure="Facts" id="p_5">2.    One of the groups, which were severally affected by

the    pandemic,      was      the     migrant         labouers.          When

Nationwide Lockdown was declared on 24.03.2020, after

few   days,    there     was     huge      exodus       of   the     migrant

labourers     from    their    place      of   work     to   their    native

places.       Two    primary    reasons        which    resulted     in   the

exodus were cessation of employment due to lockdown and

fear of the pandemic.                When large number of migrant

labourers started walking on highways on foot, cycles

and other modes of transports without food and facing

several    untold     miseries,        this     Court     suo    motu     took

cognizance of the problems and miseries of the migrant

labourers by its order dated 26.05.2020 on which date,

this Suo Motu Writ Petition had been registered.                           We

had issued the notice to the Union of India and all

States    / Union     Territories and           directed the         learned

Solicitor General to assist the Court and by the next

date of hearing bring in the notice of the Court all


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                      2</span>
measures and steps taken by the Government of India and

to be taken in this regard.
</p>
<p data-structure="Facts" id="p_6">3.     In    pursuance      of    our      order     dated          26.05.2020

affidavits were filed.            Apart from filing of affidavit

by    the    Central    Government,        States/Union           Territories,

few persons also filed intervention application in this

writ     petition      bringing    into        notice        of    this    Court

several facts, figures and suggested different measures

for     ameliorating        the   conditions            of        the     migrant

labourers.         One of the major issues, which, at that

time,       was   to   be   tackled       by   the   States         and    Union

Territories was the transportation of migrant labourers

from their work place to their native places.

</p><p data-structure="Facts" id="p_7">4.     We had issued certain directions on 28.05.2020 and

thereafter issued further directions on 09.06.2020, in

paragraph 26 of which order, we noticed following:-

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_2">        “26. As noted above, the State and Union
        Territories in their affidavits have referred
        to   various   measures,   the   orders   and
        guidelines issued by the Central Government,
        the orders issued by the National Executive
        Committee under the <a href="/doc/1166740/" id="a_1">Disaster Management Act,
        2005</a>, policies and decisions taken by the
        concerned  States.   The  States   and  Union
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                      3</span>
Territories claimed to be following all
directions and policies and taking necessary
steps for running the relief camps, shelter
camps, attending the needs of food and water
of the migrants, attending the requirement of
transportation of migrant workers to their
native places. There can be no exception to
the policies and intentions of the State but
what is important is that those on whom
implementation of circulars, policies and
schemes are entrusted are efficiently and
correctly implementing those schemes. Lapses
and short-comings in implementing the schemes
and policies have been highlighted by various
intervenors    in    their   applications    and
affidavits.    The    responsibility   of    the
States/Union Territories is not only to
referring       their      policy,      measures
contemplated, funds allocated but there has
to be strict vigilance and supervision as to
whether those measures, schemes, benefits
reaches to those to whom they are meant. We
impress on States and Union Territories to
streamline the vigilance and supervision of
actions of their officers and staff and take
appropriate action where required. We also
have no doubt that most of the officers,
staff   of   administration   and   police   are
discharging their duties with devotion and
hard-work but the lapses have to be taken
note of and remedial action be taken. We
further notice from the materials on record
that police officers of States, para-military
forces     wherever    deployed    are     doing
commendable job but some instances of excess
with regard to migrant labourers are also
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                       4</span>
     there. The migrant labourers, who were forced
     to proceed to their native place, after
     cessation of their employment are already
     suffering. The Financial difficulty being
     with all the migrant labourers invariably
     they have to dealt by the police and other
     authorities in a humane manner. The concerned
     Director     General     of     Police/Police
     Commissioner may issue necessary directions
     in this regard.”

These unorganized workers did not have any permanent

source    of employment   and have    engaged themselves        in

migrants/stranded migrants were covered and 5 Kg per

person per month free of cost dry ration for a period

of    two    months      was      given.       It    was    the    States,     who

identified about 2.8 crore migrant population in the

first    wave       of   pandemic,       which      is     clearly    stated    in

paragraph 8 of the affidavit of Union of India as noted

above. When there is identification by the States of

2.8   crore        migrants,      there       is    no   difficulty     for    the

State       in    reaching     such      migrants          and    supplying    dry

places. The Union of India in its affidavit has clearly

stated that the Union of India is ready and willing to

provide the additional food grains to the States under

various schemes in event such request is made by the

           The system of employment of inter-State
        migrant labour (known in Orissa as Dadan
        Labour) is an exploitative system prevalent
        in Orissa and in some other States. In
        Orissa,   Dadan    Labour   is   recruited   from
        various    parts     of   the    State    through
        contractors     or     agents     called Sardars/
        Khatadars for work outside the State in large
        construction projects. This system lends
        itself     to     various      abuses.     Though
        the Sardars promise      at     the    time    of
        recruitment that wages calculated on piece-
        rate basis would be settled every month, the
        promise is not usually kept. Once the worker
        comes under the clutches of the contractor,
        he takes him to a far-off place on payment of
        railway fare only. No working hours are fixed
        for these workers and they have to work on
        all the days in a week under extremely bad
        working conditions. The provisions of the
        various labour laws are not being observed in
        their case and they are subjected to various

and   intervenors     have   contended       that     though    1979

enactment has been implemented by several States but

neither there is proper licensing of contractors nor

registration of establishments due to which the migrant

workers are not able to reap the benefit to which they

are   entitled.      References of       different State,      i.e.,

State of Karnataka (2017), State of Kerala (2018) have

been made where it has been stated that 1979 enactment

has not been implemented. A legislation which has been

enacted by the Parliament as a welfare measure for the

migrant workers needs to be strictly implemented. The

affidavits   filed    on   behalf   of    different    States    and

pertaining       to     implementation             of     the       Act.      Non-

implementation of the Act adversely affects the rights

of migrant workers. We, thus, are of the view that a

direction     need       to     be    issued        to        the   States/Union

Territories to register all establishments and license

all contractors under the Act and ensure that statutory

duty imposed on the contractors to give particulars of

the    migrant        workers    is        fully        complied      with.     The

      in   the   country.    On   account    of   their

      Government for specific groups of unorganised
      sector workers such as beedi workers, non-
      coal mine workers, cine workers, handloom
      weavers, fishermen, etc. State Governments
      are   implementing    welfare   programmes    for
      certain categories of unorganised sector
      workers and some Non-Government Organisations
      also provide social security to certain
      categories of workers. Despite all these

</p><p data-structure="CDiscource" id="p_142">75.   Regarding registration of unorganized workers, the

stand taken by the Union of India as noted above does

not commend us.            We have noticed that this Court as

early as on 21.08.2018 had directed the Ministry of

Labour and Employment to make available a module to the

States/Union         Territories          for         the        purpose    of

registration. No exception can be taken to the Central

Government         deciding    to      create         NDUW       portal     for

facilitating        the    States    and        Union       Territories     to

register      so    that    national      Database          of    Unorganised

Workers may become available.               A statement is made in

the   above    paragraph      that    NIC       has    been      required   to

develop a portal for which an amount of Rs.45.39 crores

have been released in the month of January/February,

2021.     When the unorganized workers are waiting for

registration and are waiting to reap the benefit of

various welfare schemes of the States and Centre, the

apathy and lackadaisical attitude by the Ministry of

Labour    and    Employment      is        unpardonable.      There    was

urgency in the portal to be finalized and implemented

looking to the pandemic and dire need of unorganized

workers     to    receive      the        benefit.   The    attitude   of

Ministry of Labour and Employment in not completing the

module even though directed as early as on 21.08.2018

shows that Ministry is not alive to the concern of the

migrant workers and the non-action of the Ministry is

strongly disapproved.          We further direct the Secretary,

Ministry of Labour and Employment to ensure that NDUW

portal is finalized and implementation of the portal

commences on or before 31.07.2021.                   Let Secretary of

the Ministry of Labour and Employment file a report to

that effect within a period of one month thereafter.

after registration of the workers that the States and

the Centre shall be able to extend the benefits of the

welfare    schemes     to   them.    Prior          to    that       unless      the

registration is complete, tall claims by all the States

people including migrant workers but still there are
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_78">                                        74</span>
migrant    labourers, who          have not        got any      employment.

The States have been running community kitchens during

the pandemic.       We are of the view that State should run

the community kitchens at prominent places where large

number of migrant labourers are there, which community

kitchens should be continued at-least till the pandemic

continues.        The States should advertise places where

facility     of     community       kitchen/subsidized            meals    is

provided so that no migrant labour, who is unable to

arrange for his two meals can remain hungry.


</p><p data-structure="Conclusion" id="p_148">(vii)      Direct Bank Transfer to unorganized workers.

</p><p data-structure="RespArg" id="p_149">79. All States have filed their affidavits and most of

the     States     have     made        direct     bank       transfers    to

construction       workers,       who    are     registered     under     Act,

1996.     The amount ranging from Rs.1,000/- to Rs.6,000/-

has been transferred to the construction workers.                         Few

States    have     also    made    transfer        to   other    categories

including        auto     rickshaw           drivers    and     some    other

categories.       The right       of direct        bank transfer        flows

from a particular scheme framed by a State.                       In event,

a person including a migrant labourer is entitled for
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_79">                                        75</span>
any direct bank transfer from any scheme, he can claim

for such entitlement.           Before us, no such scheme by any

State     has    been     pleaded    on    record      where        conscious

decision has been taken by the State to make direct

bank transfer to a migrant labourer.                   The direct bank

transfer being matter of policy and being in domain of

the State, no direction can be issued by this Court for

any     direct     bank    transfer        as    claimed       by    certain

applicants/intervenors.             We only observe that in event

any person is entitled for direct bank transfer as per

the existing scheme in any State, he can avail the said

benefit    by     the   mechanism     as    provided      in   the     policy

decision.
